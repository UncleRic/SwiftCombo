# SwiftCombo
Exploring Functional, Prototype and Object-Oriented combo Swift

A Swift application is more than just an Objective-C app translated into Swift.
Swift offers distinct (futuristic) design patterns that yield safer run-time code than Objective-C.

This project grew out of assorted sources (i.e., Apple's 'The Swift Programming Language' book, and assorted on-line forums and lectures) to incorporate the following patterns: 
- Functional Programming,
- Object Oriented Programming,
- Design Patterns, and
- Protocol Oriented Programming


of the modern idiomatic Swift v 2.2+.

'SwiftCombo' is a work-in-process that incorporates the above four patterns.   I'm working with the familiar deck of playing cards, used in numerous discussions and lectures as my foundation.

This is my own endeavor to learn advanced Swift, with its assorted patterns.
